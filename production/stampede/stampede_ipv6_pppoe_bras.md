# TheRouter as a IPv6 PPPoE BRAS in Stampede Communitcations Pvt Ltd, India.

This is a description of the experience of using TheRouter as a PPPoE IPv6 BRAS
in a service provider network running by Stampede company from India:

	The biggest advantage of TR is salvaged servers can be turned in to at least 10K+ of users supported BRAS. 
	On the other hand, the license fee is so minimal which should be affordable to anyone.  
	Moreover its license based on throughput not number of users which is an added advantage.
	You can have a 25K users supported BRAS with minimal investment. 
	The TR tech team is very much understandable and capable to deploy any scenario which 
	I proposed and implemented in days which is amazing. Below are the other advantages
	
	1. Fully RFC compliant.
	2. Better and efficient provision of IPv6 for PPPoE 
	3. Persist both IPv4 and IPv6 even after server restarts
	4. Default IP address pool for IPv4 and IPv6 which enable easy transition for BRAS
	5. Blacklisting of nuisance subscriber 
	6. Sophisticated Token Bucket QoS helping smooth browsing experience for customer even on lower bitrate.
